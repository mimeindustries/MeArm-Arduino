MeArm Arduino
=============

This is a library for controlling the MeArm from an Arduino. It is currently a work in progress pending the release of new hardware and is not currently for use on the existing brains boards. See [this repository](https://github.com/mimeindustries/mearm-brains-arduino) if you are looking for the Arduino code to run on a brains board.
